# Detecting the Analysis Toolkit

Malware can spot other way in which lab and sandbox systems are different from the normal ones

* **Is the clipboard empty?**
* **Is the mouse cursor moving?**
* **Does the CPU have more than one core?**
* **Does the color of the foreground window change?**
* **Has the system been running for a sufficiently long tim**e?

We can bypass these evasion techniques by patching the code or changing the analysis system's setup and behavior
