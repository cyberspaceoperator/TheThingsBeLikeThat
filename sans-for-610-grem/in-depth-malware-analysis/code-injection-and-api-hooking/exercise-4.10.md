# Exercise 4.10



1. Load great.exe in Ghidra
2. Look for a call to CreateRemoteThread to the functions that runs injected code in another process
3. That function calls another functions, which invokes WritreProcessMemory to place malicious code into that process
4. This is a full-featured malware sample; we will only look at a small subset of its capabilities
