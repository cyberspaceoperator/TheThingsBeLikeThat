# Using Debuggers for Dumping

## Dumping with Debugger

1. Load the packed specimen in a debugger
   1. x64dbg will open the specimen to the entrypoint and pause (this is probably the entry point of the unpacker itself)
2. Locate the end of the unpacker and set a breakpoint there
3. Run the specimen to let in unpack the original program into memory and pause at the end of the unpacker
4. Single-step to let the process jump to the unpacked code (OEP)
5. Dump the unpacked process at that time (OllyDumpEX)
6. Fix up the PE header (using Scylla), paying attention to the IAT and EP
