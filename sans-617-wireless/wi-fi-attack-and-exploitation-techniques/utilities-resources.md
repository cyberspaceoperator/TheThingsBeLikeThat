### **Tunneling**

* **Iodine / nstx** - IP over DNS Tunneling
* **ICMPTX** - tunnel IP traffic in the payload of ICMP echo request/response frames

### **Sidejacking**

* Firesheep
* Ferret and Hamster (old)

### AIRPWN

* Hotspot injection Client Attack
* Replaces any content based on regex matching

### airtun-ng

* Use to perform type 0 attack to bypass PSPF
* Part of aircrack-ng suite of tools
* ```
  // Creates at0 interface by default to perform PSPF-bypass
  airtun-ng -a <spoofed AP MAC address> -t 0 mon0 //type 0 attack (PSPF-bypass)
  // set MAC address to at0 interface, use wireless card MAC [find using ipconfig <interface>)
  ip link set at0 address <attacker wireless card MAC>
  // set IP address
  ip a add x.x..x.x/255.255.255.0 dev at0
  ```

### wifiphisher

* attacking Preferred Network List (PNL)
* responds to probe requests for "ANY" with common list of SSIDs (ATT, airportfreewifi, etc)



### iSniff-GPS ([https://github.com/hubert3/isniff-gps](utilities-resources.md#isniff-gps-https-github.com-hubert3-isniff-gps))

* Tool to demonstrate risks associated  with Apple iOS devices, but can be extended to any wireless device
* Captures wireless traffic from a monitor mode interface or reads from libpcap file
* Stores in SQLite db
* Queries services online to find where the SSIDs may be located based on a known list of locations

```
// install isniff-gps
apt-get install python-pip python-scapy git
git clone git://github.com/hubert3/isniff-gps.git
cd iSniff-GPS
pip install -U -r requirements.txt
./manage.py syncdb

//read from pcap or interface
./run.sh -r capture.pcap
./run.sh -i mon0

/start web interface
./manage.py runserver 127.0.0.1:8080
```

### Wi-Fi Pineapple ([https://shop.hak5.org/products/wifi-pineapple](https://shop.hak5.org/products/wifi-pineapple))

### Aireplay-ng

* Can be used to perform ARP replay attacks for generating more traffic to be used for key guessing for WEP

### Wifite2 ([https://github.com/derv82/wifite2](utilities-resources.md#undefined))

{% hint style="warning" %}
Apparently this tool performs DoS when it doesn't need to, so be careful
{% endhint %}

* Automate steps associated with attacking wifi networks (WEP/WPA/WPA2)
* Provided easy interface to ident, attack, and perform password guessing operations

### airdecap-ng

* Reads encrypted pcap file, outputs unencrypted pcap file

```
airdecap-ng -w 00:01:02:03:04:05:06 <file>.dump
```
