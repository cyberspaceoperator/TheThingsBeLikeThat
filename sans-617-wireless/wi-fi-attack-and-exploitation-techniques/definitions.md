# Definitions

**Service Theft** - Unauthorized user gains access without proper authentication

* **Iodine / nstx** - IP over DNS Tunneling
* **ICMPTX** - tunnel IP traffic in the payload of ICMP echo request/response frames

**Sidejacking** - Impersonate logged in users by observing traffic and replaying authentication tokens

**PSPF** - Private VLAN or station isolation for 802.11 (prevents STAs from communicating within BSS)&#x20;

* [Use airtun to perform PSPF bypass](wi-fi-client-attacks.md#defeating-pspf-w-airtun-part-of-aircrack-ng-suite)

**PNL** - Preferred network list, STAs maintain list of networks previously connected to, complete with passwords, settings, etc.

WEP - Wireless encryption protocol&#x20;

RC4 - Stream cipher, 40-bit shared key or 104-bit shared-key and a 23-bit IV value to ensure same key is not used twice

RTS - Request to Send

CTS - Clear to Send

**Michael Algorithm** - Shuts down the radio after 2 invalid message integrity checks

**DoS** - Denial of Service

* Deauth
* RTS/CTS (Medium Reservation)
* Jamming (illegal)
* TKIP Replay Attack - JROCKET (https://willhackforsushi/code/jrockets-0.1.tgz)
* Short range (100 feet indoors)
* If you want Long Range, you need targeted high-gain equipment

Fuzzing - Fault testing technique

* Leveraged by QA teams
* Bug discovery
* Can lead to RCE (Remote code execution)
* Test to see how something operates, try to break the shit out of it
* Used to guide developers to improve/address their code to make it more secure
*

SSID Information Element

* SSID is 0-32 octets
* SSID length 0 is for Probe Requests indicate wildcard SSID
* But the TLV (Total Length Value parameter field can indicate 255 bytes)
  * So if you set the total length to 255 and you send a bunch of 0x41 to it, it'll copy that to an SSID field that can only be 32 bytes long.
