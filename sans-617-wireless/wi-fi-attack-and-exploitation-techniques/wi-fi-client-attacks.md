# Wi-Fi Client Attacks

### Hotspot Injection(1)

![Hotspot injection process](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (66) (1).png>)

1. Attacker exploits race condition (normal latency for websites is 50ms, you're closer), spoofing remote server
   1. Injects arbitrary responses on open-authentication networks
2. Attacker manipulates any TCP of UDP sessions
   1. Exploits trust of targeted server
   2. Easy to demonstrate with HTTP

**AirPwn**

* Hotspot injection Client Attack
* Replaces any content based on regex matching

### Defeating PSPF w/ airtun (part of aircrack-ng suite)

To defeat PSPF, an attacker can inject traffic into the wireless network and send traffic directly to the victim. Eve can set the From-DS flag and clear the To-DS flag, which makes the traffic look like it came from their access point. In order to capture the victim's response to the traffic, the attacker would also have to be sniffing the network traffic since PSPF would drop the response.

```
// Creates at0 interface by default to perform PSPF-bypass
airtun-ng -a <spoofed AP MAC address> -t 0 mon0 //type 0 attack (PSPF-bypass)
// set MAC address to at0 interface, use wireless card MAC [find using ipconfig <interface>)
ip link set at0 address <attacker wireless card MAC>
// set IP address
ip a add x.x..x.x/255.255.255.0 dev at0

```

### Attacking PNL

* Respond to probe requests for "ANY" with a massive list of well-known AP names
  * **wifiphisher** (comes with default list of common SSIDs around the globe \[can be changed]
  * [iSniffGPS ](utilities-resources.md#isniff-gps-https-github.com-hubert3-isniff-gps)

### Impersonating multiple SSIDs (Karma Attack)

{% hint style="warning" %}
Use this attack with caution, it will respond to everything, even stuff out of scope
{% endhint %}

* Responds to all probe requests regardless of SSID: "I'm every network"
* Attempts to lure client devices into a fake network environment established to manipulate and compromise client devices
