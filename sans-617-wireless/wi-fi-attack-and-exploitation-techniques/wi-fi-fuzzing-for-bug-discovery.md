# Wi-Fi Fuzzing for Bug Discovery

**Fuzzing** - Fault testing technique

* When is fuzzing appropriate?
  * Encryption and auth mechanisms are strong
  * Rogue detection is successful
  * Client vulns have been addressed
  * Wide-scale rollout of new Wi-Fi device or technology
* Leveraged by QA teams
* Bug discovery
* Can lead to RCE (Remote code execution)
  * format string attacks
  * buffer overfows
  * heap spraying
  * integer errors
  * etc
* Test to see how something operates, try to break the shit out of it

### **SSID Information Element Fuzzing Example**

* SSID is 0-32 octets
* SSID length 0 is for Probe Requests indicate wildcard SSID
* But the TLV (Total Length Value parameter field can indicate 255 bytes)
  * So if you set the total length to 255 and you send a bunch of 0x41 to it, it'll copy that to an SSID field that can only be 32 bytes long.

**Tshark** - Capture traffic during fuzzing, or you can use wireshark...whatever

* Tshark is included with wireshark, it's just the text-based version
