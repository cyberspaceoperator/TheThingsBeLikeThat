# Malware Persistence

## Malware Persistence Mechanisms

* **AutoStart Locations**
  * **Examples:**
    * ****![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (70).png>)****
* **Service Creation / Replacement**
  * Start value set to 0x02 will start automatically
  * **Service replacement**
    * Modify and autostart a service to load a new binary
    * GlassRAT (China) used the disabled "RasAuto" Service
* **Service Failure Recovery**
* **Scheduled Tasks (Remotely scheduled or locally)**
* **DLL Hijacking**
  * **DLL Search Order Hijacking (**[**https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/dlls/dynamic-link-library-search-order**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/dlls/dynamic-link-library-search-order)**)**
  * **Phantom DLL Hijacking (**[**http://www.hexacorn.com/blog/2013/12/08/beyond-good-ol-run-key-part-5/**](http://www.hexacorn.com/blog/2013/12/08/beyond-good-ol-run-key-part-5/)**)**
  * **DLL Sideloading (**[**https://www.mandiant.com/resources/dll-side-loading-a-thorn-in-the-side-of-the-anti-virus-industry**](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/dll-side-loading-a-thorn-in-the-side-of-the-anti-virus-industry)**)**
  * **Relative Path DLL Hijacking**
* **WMI Event Consumers (utilizes WMIPrvSE.exe to execute)**
  * WMI provides the ability to monitor for events and then trigger an event that runs scripts or executes code
  * Runs with SYSTEM
  * 3 Steps:
    * An event filter must be created
    * An event consumer is added to the system with a script and/or executable to run
    * The event and consumer are tied together via a binding
  * Audit these with powershell (**Get-WMIObject**) or **Kansa** ([https://github.com/davehull/Kansa](https://github.com/davehull/Kansa))
*   **Autoruns**
